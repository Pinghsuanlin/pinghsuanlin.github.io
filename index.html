Hey there, I'm Sherie originally from Taiwan. Currently, a full-time data scientist/content curator/foodie based in the US. 

ðŸ‘€ I'm a data scientist at [AES Corporation](https://www.aes.com) focusing on clean energy O&M sector. I handled big data with BigQuery, built ad-hoc reports with PowerBI, used Python & R interchangeably for statistical, time series analysis and data modeling at work. 

ðŸŒš I enjoy working in silence, but am equally kown to collaborate across team, and engage team members to achieve the common goal. With my internationally experienced and diverser academic background, I'm always open to new ideas and approaches to business questions. 

I share some of my past project, personal journey here and there. Welcome to my page and feel free to reach out/ connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinghsuanlin).

ðŸš© Alumn of Columbia University in the city of New York (MS in Applied Analytics), and National Taiwan University (BA in History, minor in Agricultural Economics).
